ChatRWS - Reflection Without Surveillance

ChatRWS is a minimalist self-reflection tool that mimics certain chat interfaces without any backend or data storage.
It invites users to write and release their thoughts: no feedback, no history, no tracking.

# Features

## 100% local: nothing leaves your device
## No analytics, APIs, or databases
## Messages fade away after a few seconds

# Concept
In the current paradigm of data collection and dopamine loops, ChatRWS offers a quiet space for introspection. A place to express without being observed or optimized.

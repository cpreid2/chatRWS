ChatRWS - Reflect Without Surveillance
https://cpreid2.github.io/chatRWS/

ChatRWS is a minimalist self-reflection tool that mimics certain chat interfaces without any backend or data storage. It restores the sanctity of private reflection in an time where the self has been productized.
It invites users to write and release their thoughts: no feedback, no history, no tracking.


# Features

## 100% local: nothing leaves your device
## No analytics, APIs, or databases
## Messages fade away after a few seconds

# Concept
In the current paradigm of data collection and dopamine loops, ChatRWS offers a quiet space for introspection. A place to express without being observed or optimized.
